	<p id="explanation">Ross and Amanda Carter are happy to welcome you to their lovely home in Hythe, a small town by the sea in Kent. Hythe is a historic port town, which is 25km from Canterbury and Dover. It is also very easy to visit London from Hythe. The house where you will stay is right in the centre of Hythe and is a short walk from the beach and the High Street. Ross has been teaching English for over 10 years, has a degree in French and a passion for languages and other cultures.<br><br>	You'll spend the week with the family and you will be encouraged to speak English as much as possible throughout your stay. Usually, you'll have lessons in the morning and spend the afternoon on a cultural visit. You'll visit famous tourist spots such as Canterbury Cathedral and Dover Castle, and we have also arranged trips to the theatre, music and sporting events(including Premier League and Champions League football matches). In the lessons, you'll have discussions on a wide range of subjects, including your work, your studies, family life and interests. The lessons will be adapted to your level of English and we can work together to improve your language skills and grammar.
